## Technical Communication Report

I took Technical and Professional Communication in the Spring of 2024, which focused on professional communication skills and the presentation of research in a refined manner. My project focused on the implementation of walkable city infrastructure to increase urban sustainability, and through this assignment I gained valuable knowledge such as:

-   Approaching complex topics in an analytical manner and communicating an unbiased perspective on sustainability issues.

-   Organizing documents to streamline the reader's experience and present clear arguments.

-   Demonstrating a robust understanding of technical communication principles and applications to my field.
